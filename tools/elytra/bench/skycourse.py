"""A ring course in the sky on a shared survival server, built by the bot itself in creative.

    python skycourse.py plan             # print the cells, change nothing
    python skycourse.py check            # read the world: every cell to fill must be air, with room around
    python skycourse.py build [from]     # build it (spine, then the rings in order), from piece `from`
    python skycourse.py fly [--video]    # fly the rings, print the misses

Nothing is placed in mid-air: a block needs a face to go against, so the rings stand on posts on
a one-block spine of white concrete that runs west from the edge of the platform at y=114. The
spine starts against the platform's own edge, each ring's post starts on the spine, and every
cell of a piece is listed so that it touches one placed before it (the build queue places a
batch bottom-up). Nothing is broken: the build policy forbids it before anything starts.

The zone (a plot on a shared server, given by its owner): the strip z -175..-148 west of x -563, the platform's
top at y=114, open air beyond its western edge at x=-635.
