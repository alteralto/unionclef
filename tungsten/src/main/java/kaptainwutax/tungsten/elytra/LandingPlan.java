/**
 * A landing the physics can fly: from where the glider is to a touchdown on the ground at the spot,
 * soft enough to take no damage. A move holds one look for {@link #HOLD} ticks, turned no faster
 * than the bot turns, flown through {@link ElytraPhysics}, no new rockets (a landing sheds energy;
 * one still pulling, the take-off's on a short hop, is flown out). The
 * search ends on a move that touches the ground, and only one that touches it softly, then slides to
 * within {@link Options#reach} of the spot.
 *
 * <p>Soft: while a glide sinks slower than 0.5 blocks a tick the game keeps its fall distance at 1;
 * faster, the fall adds up, and over 3 blocks it hurts. The search keeps the same count, from a
 * sink of {@link #SOFT} for a margin, and asks for at most {@link Options#maxFall} at the touch. A move that meets a block on its way across (a
 * wall, a tree) is out: gliding into a wall is the other way elytra hurt.
 *
 * <p>The heuristic is a lower bound of the ticks left: the way at top speed, and the energy (height +
 * v^2/0.16) above a touchdown's at the fastest a glide sheds it, a steep turning dive (measured on
 * the physics: 1.34 a tick at 2.2 blocks a tick). Without the energy term every start high over the
 * spot ran out of budget circling it; with it, on flat ground, seven starts from 20 to 80 blocks
 * out and 3 to 30 up all found a landing, 1.5-3.5 blocks off, in 5 to 1 845 states.
